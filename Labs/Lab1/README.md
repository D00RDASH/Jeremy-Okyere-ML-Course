In the Titanic lab, I ran cells and questions related to what I learned from Modules 1 through 10. The chosen model was being trained to predict a certain target variable within the dataset, who survived. This was being figured out based on the information from the dataset's features. 

This program helped educate me on the key differences between traditional programming and machine learning, and essential libraries in Python utilized for machine learning. I also learned that women and children were more likely to have survived the Titanic due to the "Women and Children First!" Policy, I learned about the key differences between bias and variance, both high and low, and I got to understand the random forest model and how it works. 

I don't remember facing any challenges during this lab, just got to learn a lot of important concepts from the lab.
