A README.md file that explains what you did in that lab. What did you learn? What challenges did you face?

The "Midterm Project - Data Storytelling" assignment was the next lab to come after Lab ten, and it was building off what I previously learned from Lab ten. In the Data Storytelling Midterm Project, I uncovered patterns, made observations, and gained insights within the dataset I trained my model on. There were two datasets to choose from. I chose the Titanic dataset, the same dataset I trained my model on in Lab ten. Throughout the project, I had to interact with the code in the lab and answer questions.

I learned about categorical encoding and that you can encode certain features from a dataset.
