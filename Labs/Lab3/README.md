The "Midterm Project - Data Storytelling" assignment was the next lab to come after Lab ten, and it was building off what I previously learned from Lab ten. In the Data Storytelling Midterm Project, I uncovered patterns, made observations, and gained insights within the dataset I trained my model on. There were two datasets to choose from. I chose the Titanic dataset, the same dataset I trained my model on in Lab ten. Throughout the project, I had to interact with the code in the lab and answer questions.

I learned about categorical encoding and that you can encode certain features from a dataset. I also learned why encoding is necessary and learn about the 3 different types of encoding: One-Hot encoding, Label/Ordinal Encoding, and Target/Frequency Encoding, what makes them different from each other, and the types of data that each type of encoding needs. I also learned about how true negatives can affect how accurate a model can be when analyzing data. Due to this lab being more interactive, reflective, I unfortunately did not come across any challenges during the lab. Therefore, I hope to receive guidance on future labs, causing me to have to do some critical thinking, leading me to learn and overcome any mistakes and challenges that I may encounter on my own in the future for more learning experience.
