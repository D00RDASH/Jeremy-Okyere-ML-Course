A README.md file that explains what you did in that lab. What did you learn? What challenges did you face?

In the bonus lab, I trained two models to classify wine in a wine dataset and built my own model to classify wine in the wine dataset.

I learned about the different types of machine learning through demostration: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement.
