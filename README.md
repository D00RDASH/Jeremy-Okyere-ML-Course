Course Name: Intro to Machine Learning

Hi, I like to watch YouTube and Netflix, and play video games.
I'd like to construct AI models that can protect databases and servers, construct AI models that help robots to be able to navigate harsh 
planet terrain, or construct an AI that can detect anomalies that humans will miss in medical image scans and X-rays. I have many interests.
