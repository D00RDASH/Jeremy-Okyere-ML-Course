For each assignment, you should also have a dedicated folder with your code and a README.md file. The README for your assignments should be more detailed and explain:
1) The problem you were trying to solve.
2) Your approach and the methods you used.
3) The results you got and what they mean.

For the Google Collab EDA assignment, I needed to write a paragraph of at least 100 words explaining how I think the code works. In the Google Collab EDA, three different types of EDA analysis: Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate, were being conducted on a laptop dataset. I analyzed the code and made observations while running the code. This was what I wrote on my understanding of how the code works step by step:

First, the code transports the files into the kaggle/input directory. The variable 'df' is used to access a certain file from input. As for what the code is doing, I think it analyzes the dataset and splits it into two sections: categorical and numerical. The program basically does an inventory check (tracks the amount in each variable solely) using tables, graphs, and pie charts using univariate analysis. for each topic in categorical and then in numerical. Next, the program compares two variables and displays the comparison using a graph. Lastly, the program shows the correlation between the laptop attributes compared to each other and how the numerical features correlate with the dependent variable.
